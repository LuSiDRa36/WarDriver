This was a project I started back in November 2019, when I first learned of Python's existence. I first became interested in this project when I came across the application Wiggle. The application assists in the collection of SSID information of nearby routers/relay systems, only using your cell phone.
The concept of the collection and mapping of large data sets using Follium and Pandas made it a fun project to undertake . Results would be aggregated on the map by the the usage of Pandas, and Follium. Delimited by a set of given filters and propagated on the map according to geolocation coordinates from given CSV file. I have been using this script for many years, collecting many data sets from my travels.
